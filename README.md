Quick dataset speedruns
<br>
I don't have any particular reason to do this, other than that I'm a bit bored sometimes and would like to rest and chill in the evening while listening to my Weekly Discover and Release Radar playlists, or a melodious Arctic Monkeys album on Spotify :headphones:  <br>
"Professionalism" is probably the least important during these sessions, one would say I'm just vibing. Sometimes tho' I set up goals to progress in a direction if I feel like I should be practicing something particular. :unlock: <br>
The datasets below also suggest that the most important thing for me here is relatability. I might not spend a lot of time on a dataset if it's not what I thought it was. :hourglass_flowing_sand: <br>
