Quick  speedruns

I don't have any particular reason to do this, other than that I'm a bit bored sometimes and would like to rest and chill in the evening while listening to my Weekly Discover and Release Radar playlists, or a melodious Arctic Monkeys album on Spotify :headphones:  <br>

"Professionalism" is probably the least important during these sessions, one would say I'm just vibing. Sometimes tho' I set up goals to progress in a direction if I feel like I should be practicing something particular. :unlock: <br>

The datasets below also suggest that the most important thing for me here is relatability. I might not spend a lot of time on a dataset if it's not what I thought it was and it doesn't interest me. :hourglass_flowing_sand: <br>

*If for some reason you're lurking here, please contact me if you know a fun dataset! Cheers :clinking_glasses:!*
